# Age Estimation Project with Computer Vision
This project aims to conduct a comparative study of age estimation models using computer vision. We have implemented a custom model as well as three pre-trained models: VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50. These models have been tailored to our dataset by adding layers and making specific modifications.
